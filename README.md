## Intro

Progress bar is a small module written in [vlang](https://github.com/vlang/v) to create progress bar on cli. It's a port of [doches/progressbar](https://github.com/doches/progressbar). It aims to provide complete functionality of the original project.

Currently only progress bar has been implemented and nothing is being exported.
